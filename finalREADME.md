# WDI-SM-62: Project ZERO ... by Joy Serquiña)
### Build a Portfolio Website
I've created a portfolio site where I can easily update any future/upcoming projects upon completion.  I've also designed it to showcase my skills outside of web development as well.

### My Process
1. I started off by sketching out wireframes of each section as shown here:
	1a & 1b Landing and Portfolio page ![Landing Page](https://i.imgur.com/ZamMXTg.jpg]
	!1e & 1f.[1c & 1d About/Skills Page](https://i.imgur.com/jNKaYt8.jpg) About me /Skills page and Contact/Testimonial page
	 Quotes/Testimonial Page
	1f. Contact form
2. Also sketched a tablet version: ![Tablet wireframe sketch](https://i.imgur.com/JUJZAPS.jpg)
3. Also sketched out a wireframe for a mobile version: ![Mobile version sketch](https://i.imgur.com/3fPGyHo.jpg)
4. I then created my user stories in trello to list the actions they would take, what they would see etc: ![Screencapture of trello to do list](https://i.imgur.com/UbPS9LE.png).
5. Talked through my ideas/ processes with Zac and Alex for approval.
6. Create a new git repo for the project.
6. Wrote up the HTML for the bare bones start.
7. Applied very basic boxes to tweak/toggle to try and get my wireframe developed.
8. Did research, found a codepen that helped me figure out how to structure my divs using flex and grid.
9. Implemented the code I was experimenting with into my grid for my portfolio section. ![Grid code](https://i.imgur.com/oz91BIa.png).
10. Input placeholder medias so I can view/try to enable any JS or jQuery.
11. Put together a photo carousel.  The first one I put together was only toggled via the dot controls which worked (at the time).
12. Attempted the JavaScript methods.
13. Upon completing the JS methods or was close to it I worked on fine tuning any spacing and/or blueprints/designs.
14. Did research on the methods to approach the main queries for the project: the navBar, the carousel, the transition quote fade in/out.
15. Took notes and attempted to put together something that would work for their method
16. Struggled with the carousel to get it BOTH controlled and auto slides: ![Screencapture of my JS snippet of my attempt at building a function](https://i.imgur.com/Poc8wFc.png).
17. Created the sticky footer nav bar using CSS toggle that only shows up in mobile/responsive mode: ![Screencapture of screen in mobile mode to show burger pop up menu](https://i.imgur.com/suegizs.jpg).
18. Continued to tweak design/layout as things affected each other during each of the changes.
19. Added all links to previous work, images, and icons.
20. Used primarily HTML/CSS to make the site responsive.
21. Made `git add` and `git commit` and `git push` regularly to continuously keep my repo's and git activity updated.

##Unsolved Problems:
* Need to enable control buttons for slideshow
* Highlight of navbar when you're in the specific section on your page
* I wanted to use my header as my slideshow but I was having difficulty so I created a separate younger one.
* *Bonus: add validation to contact form to make sure user has filled out all required fields before submitting.
* *Bonus: add functionality for carousel to swipe while using an iPad/iPhone.
* *Utilize an API.
* I need/want to get better at writing cleaner & dry-er.

## Wins :)
*Got my hero image to be styled the way I want it with the text overlaying it ![hero image of my page with the text overlaying it](https://imgur.com/nyrK1TK)... ![here's the code for the html](https://i.imgur.com/0GKHkRI.png).
*Got my footer navbar to work after struggling with it for so long.
*Got the transition/fade in/out of the quotes to work using jQuery:

Steps to creating my site:

1. Create the wireframe... see sketches attached:

2. Enter in the HTML for the basis of the site... see screencaps attached.

3. Used codepen.io to test out/work out spacing for the Portfolio section using CSS Grid... see attached images.
4. Copied the similar structure/CSS Grid for the Portfolio section and applied it to the About/Skills/Contact/Testimonail sections.

5. Attempted to do a slideshow for the Header Hero Image... but was unsuccessful... I have a JS snippet that I started creating, but it wasn't
  working... but I feel like I was on the right track so I kept it in my JS file to play around with later.
  
6.
